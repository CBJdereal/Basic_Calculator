# Calculator Project

This is a simple web-based calculator project. The project consists of three main files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`. Together, these files create a functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Project Structure

```

### Files Description

- **index.html**: This file contains the HTML structure of the calculator. It includes the display screen and the buttons for the calculator's interface.
- **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styling for the calculator. It defines the layout, colors, and overall appearance of the calculator.
- **index.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code that makes the calculator functional. It includes functions to handle button clicks, perform calculations, and update the display.

### Features

- **Display**: Shows the current input or result of the calculation.
